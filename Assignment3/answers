1) Plot the training and validation losses, as well as the training and validation accuracies, as a function
of the training iteration.


2) What is the test accuracy?


3) Calculate, by hand, the total number of parameters of the model, and indicate, step by step, how
you reached your solution.


4) Very briefly, compare, in terms of performance and computational complexity, this model with the
models that you implemented in the previous assignments.
